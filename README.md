#Project 2

I wanted to go for a simple game so i thought tic tac toe would be simple enough.
The website is very direct as it goes stright into the game and has a simplistic style and eay to play. 
The site tell which player either X or O to play and when they have won it annonce the winner when the tie it announces the tie. Once this is done the user are free to leave or restart the game and pay all over again. 
going through the js i need to comment out nearly all the code so that i could understand it being able to do that help as it becomes systmatic and logical. 
The website passes the JS, CSS and html checks with only minor warming on the Js and css its also very responsive being simplistic and is good on most devices. 

I struggled the most when needing to wrap my head around the wincondition and the array as it factors in all the elements to achieve the win. i was able to get around it by researching about it using "MDN WebDocs" and "freecodecamp".
